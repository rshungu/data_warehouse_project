ðŸš€ Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project Repository

This project presents a complete data warehousing and analytics solution, covering everything from data ingestion to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it adheres to industry best practices in data engineering and analytics, demonstrating efficient data modeling, transformation, and reporting.

## Data Architecture  

The project follows the **Medallion Architecture**, which is organized into three layers:

- **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data directly from source systems.
- **Silver Layer**: Cleans, standardizes, and organizes the data to make it ready for analysis.  
- **Gold Layer**: Transforms the data into a structured model suitable for reporting and generating insights.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project focuses on building a modern data solution with the following components:

1. **Data Architecture:**  
  Implementing a Medallion Architecture with **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers to ensure scalable and reliable data management.

2. **ETL Pipelines:**  
  Designing and developing ETL processes to **extract**, **transform**, and **load** data from source systems into the data warehouse.

3. **Data Modeling:**  
  Creating optimized **fact** and **dimension** tables to support efficient analytical queries.

4. **Analytics & Reporting:**  
  Developing **SQL-based reports** and **dashboards** to deliver meaningful and actionable insights.

## ðŸ›  Project Requirements

### A. Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)
#### Objective

Design and implement a modern data warehouse using **SQL Server** to consolidate sales data, supporting analytical reporting and informed business decision-making.

#### Specifications

- **Data Sources:**  
  Load data from two source systems â€” **ERP** and **CRM** â€” provided as CSV files.

- **Data Quality:**  
  Perform data cleansing to identify and resolve quality issues before analysis.

- **Integration:**  
  Merge both sources into a unified, user-friendly **data model** optimized for analytical queries.

- **Scope:**  
  Focus on the most recent dataset only (no historization or time-based tracking required).

- **Documentation:**  
  Deliver clear and concise documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.

### B. BI Analytics and Reporting
#### Objective

Create **SQL-based analytics** to provide comprehensive insights into:

- **Customer Behavior**
- **Product Performance**
- **Sales Trends**

These insights equip stakeholders with critical business metrics to support **strategic decision-making** and drive informed actions.
